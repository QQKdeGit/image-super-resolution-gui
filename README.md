# image-super-resolution-gui

> This app takes advantage of [xinntao/Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)

## How to use

- Download the installer from [releases](https://github.com/charlie0129/image-super-resolution-gui/releases), install it, and run it.
- If you start the app for the first time, you will need to fill the path to [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases) directory (where the executable resides). There is a ? icon near the text field, click it to show more info. This operation is only needed once.
- Drag 'n' drop a image, choose a model (you can guess what model you need by its name), then click SUPER-RESOLUTION! Wait for the results... The calculated image is saved right next to the original image.
- Optionally, drag out the image to somewhere you need, or use `Zoom further` to display the image 1:1 for better comparison.
